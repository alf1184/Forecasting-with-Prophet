# Forecasting-with-Prophet
This project explores the predicting capabilities of Prophet, Meta's package for time series analysis.

In particular, the available code analyzes Bitcoin's evolution over time. However, the same analysis can be applied to other relevant economic variables.

All relevant data is downloaded by the script itself.

The first part uses only the information of the time series itself to make predictions. The second part also includes relevant Google trends as exogenous variables to extend the model's predictive capabilities.

DISCLAIMER: The second part of the script is not currently running as the function that retrieves trends over time is blocked by Google.
